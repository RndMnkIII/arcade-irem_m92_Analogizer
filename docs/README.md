# Irem M92 Compatible Gateware IP Core with support for Analogizer-FPGA adapter
* Analogizer V1.0   [19/05/2024]: Added initial support for Analogizer adapter (RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C, SVGA Scandoubler)
* V1.0.1 [30/05/2024]: Fixed YPbPr video output. Check ✴️ notes before ask support for YPbPr video output.

Adapted to Analogizer by [@RndMnkIII](https://github.com/RndMnkIII) based on **opengateware** Irem M92 Compatible Gateware IP Core.

The core can output RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C and SVGA scandoubler (50% scanlines) video signals.

| Video output | Status |
| :----------- | :----: |
| RGBS         |  ✅    |
| RGsB         |  ✅    |
| YPbPr        |  ✴️    |
| Y/C*         |  ✅    |
| Scandoubler  |  ✅    |

✴️ YPbPr support will vary among the different supported games in this core and the specific screen that you use.
Tested on a JVC PVM In the Hunt is displayed correctly but R-Type Leo not. Using OSSC scaler works well in all games. Using a LG LED TV is not displayed correctly.

* **Analogizer** is responsible for generating the correct encoded Y/C signals from RGB and outputs to R,G pins of VGA port. Also redirects the CSync to VGA HSync pin.
The required external Y/C adapter that connects to VGA port is responsible for output Svideo o composite video signal using his internal electronics. Oficially
only the Mike Simone Y/C adapters (active) designs will be supported by Analogizer and will be the ones to use.

Support native PCEngine/TurboGrafx-16 2btn, 6 btn gamepads and 5 player multitap using SNAC adapter
and PC Engine cable harness (specific for Analogizer). Many thanks to [Mike Simone](https://github.com/MikeS11/MiSTerFPGA_YC_Encoder) for his great Y/C Encoder project.

For output Y/C and composite video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC` or `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC,Pocket OFF`.
For output Scandoubler SVGA video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Scandoubler RGBHV`.

You will need to connect an active VGA to Y/C adapter to the VGA port (the 5V power is provided by VGA pin 9). I'll recomend one of these (active):
* [MiSTerAddons - Active Y/C Adapter](https://misteraddons.com/collections/parts/products/yc-active-encoder-board/)
* [MikeS11 Active VGA to Composite / S-Video](https://ultimatemister.com/product/mikes11-active-composite-svideo/)
* [Active VGA->Composite/S-Video adapter](https://antoniovillena.com/product/mikes1-vga-composite-adapter/)

Using another type of Y/C adapter not tested to be used with Analogizer will not receive official support.
